            I am Rahul, a Data Engineer at CloudEQS, driven by my passion for exploring the endless possibilities of data. With expertise in tools like Matillion, Snowflake, and SQL, I thrive on creating innovative solutions that simplify complex problems and empower decision-making.

            Beyond the world of data, I am a writer at heart. Inspired by life’s highs and lows, I channel my thoughts and emotions into Shairi, where I find the freedom to express what words often fail to capture. Writing, for me, is more than just a hobby—it's a way to connect with others, to tell stories that resonate, and to leave a lasting impact.
